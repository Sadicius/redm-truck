# RedM Truck script - STANDALONE

## About

The RedM Truck is a port of an asset from Polks Car packs originally for FiveM. 

## Key Features

- **Synchronization**: Workarounds were discovered to keep the car visible upon new player join and for players to see eachother in the drivers seat
- **Sounds**: Using the PMMS resource by Kibook, https://github.com/kibook/pmms, the truck has sounds similar to a real truck (work in progress) 
- **Capable**: From offroading to hillclimbs the truck is fun to drive around in the world of Red Dead

## Installation

1. Drag and drop redm-truck into server resources
2. Install Pmms then drag and drop all mp3s into pmms/http/media
3. Ensure pmms and redm-truck
